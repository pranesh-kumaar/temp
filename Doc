Jeeva Shantanu

He would claim it was thundering more than just raining. Riding his horse as steadily as he could while crossing the muddy slopes of Mount Arvata. He grumbled, “Why must it rain so heavily today?” Both his horse and him could scarcely see anything, though it was merely afternoon.  A trail of blood marked their path from the deer carcass draped over the horse’s back. His hunting trip had been eventful. "At least I had a good hunt," he thought.
Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck a few thousand yards ahead, its brilliance blinded both the man and the beast. Startled, the horse reared and threw him to the ground and bolted towards the forest. He lay in the mud, his face smeared with soil. "Ah! I am bleeding," he muttered, realizing he had struck a rock. The thunder that followed was more than deafening—it was a whisper. "Yield your petty throne, so weak and par; your true calling lies afar; Cross the mountains, leave your kin; For a bond not born within."
As the thunder faded, he lay in disbelief, realizing what had transpired. This was no ordinary whisper; it was clear, precise, and undeniable. Never had he experienced anything like it before.
It was mid-evening when he finally reached Shylver shila, the castle of the Shylvers. He knew it was not the hour to reveal his revelations, especially not to any within his kin. Yet, he could scarcely contain his eagerness to share the whispers and seek another's opinion. Foregoing the family feast that night, he dressed himself as a commoner and slipped out the castle, through the lateral gate, guarded by the twins with whom he grew up with. They knew where he was going that night, but merely greeted him. As swordsmen, they shared a childhood together, but that was all. The most they could do was keep his secrets. For Shantanu, the younger, there was no price to their silence.
The prince waddled along a dim corridor. At last, he reached the heavy wooden door he sought and, with a firm push, entered. Within, the silken sheets were waiting, and so was Shija. 
"I thought my prince had forgotten me," her dress draped artfully over what seemed to be glass jars, potteries, and plates, hinting at a feast prepared for him. She lay sprawled upon a map of Shylva Vrata, nude, her body covering the peaks and valleys. Was it Arvata where she reclined, or perhaps Girvata? One mountain peak looked much like another, with no names to guide his eyes.
"Ah, I've had quite the adventure of my own, my Prince," her voice smooth as silk. "Hunting over peaks and mountains," she continued, "and now my prey has fallen into my grasp."
"And what prey might that be, Shija?", a playful smirk on his lips as he kneeled towards her.
"You, my Prince," her lips curving into a sly smile. “Will you let me chase you a bit or shall I devour you here and now?” She straddled him, her hands exploring the contours of his chest. The world outside the chamber ceased to exist; there was only Shija, her eyes burning with a passion that matched his own.
As his eyes darkened with desire, her fingers deftly undid the fastenings of his garments, revealing the taut muscles beneath. She marveled at the feel of his skin, warm under her touch. It was then that she noticed the gash marring his forehead. “Vulnerable, yet unyielding,” as she traced the cut with her finger. “Is it right to hunt a prey that’s hurt?”
He pulled her closer, his hands reaching her back. "Shija," he breathed, “Hurt or not, I won’t flee. You’re irresistible."
She laughed softly, "And you, my Prince, are my most willing prey." Her lips found his, a kiss that started soft and gentle, but quickly grew into a fierce dance of tongues. Shantanu’s breath quickened, his hands finding their way to her hips, pulling her closer.
His clothes discarded carelessly onto the cold stone floor. She guided him, her movements commanding, until they were one, their bodies moving in a rhythm. 
The map beneath them crinkled and shifted, its warm, leathery texture enough to caress them both. The room echoed with gasps and moans, the unnamed peaks, and valleys the only witness to their passion. As their desires peaked, Shija broke into a cry of ecstasy, followed by the prince’s. The once pristine parchment beneath now holds the memory of their fervor.
For a long moment, they lay over the map, their breaths mingling in the cool night air. Shija rested her head on Santanu’s chest, a satisfied smile playing on her lips. “You were a worthy hunt, my Prince,” she murmured.
Shantanu, his heart still racing, could only agree. “Shija, in this game, we are both the hunted.” his words only to make her flushed. He held her close, for some time, {before he wanted to convey what he truly came for…., hen fancied to go one more time}
“Fetch me some golden mead, would you? “, his voice low. 
She left, smiling, “Will do, “as she pulled her drape, revealing the feast beneath. “You shall also taste the feast my maids helped me with” as she loosely wrapped herself, her bare skin still visible beneath the flowing fabric.
As she shuffled the shelf for turmeric, “Where did you come by this map “? he questioned. 
"I had one of my maids procure a map for me—it's obvious why. I have always wanted to ravish you on one. She claimed she got it for a mere pittance of dinars.”
He examined the map closely. “Maps this big and this detailed are not sold; they are commissioned, made only for nobles on request. This one looks very well crafted, though it lacks names. “, he paused momentarily “This is a map of our Lord’s reign, his entire domain.”
As she brought the mead to him, now seated at the feast table, she leaned in closer, “Should my prince desire a map for hisself, I shall inquire the maid for the origin of this one. We shall task the maker to craft one for you, of course all locales named, but with intimate titles.”, {she said that last bit seducingly.}
As she moved to sit beside him, he swiftly pulled her onto his lap. “Would he map and title your contours?” he teased, taking a sip of the mead. She giggled, her arms around his neck and his hands on her thighs.{}
{“The Arvata peaks of your breasts, the Varaaha curves of your hips, or the Kurinji valley between your legs?", he chuckled as she laughed even harder. His hands moving {inside her drape} to cup her breasts, thumbs brushing over her hardened nipples; he leaned in, their lips meeting in a gentle, exploring a kiss.}
He loved her truly for how satiable she is, perhaps that was all. He desired to have her every way a man could possibly have a woman, yet beyond that physical desire, his emotions are uncertain. “Could I see her for who she is, beyond how she makes me feel?” he pondered as his tongue left her mouth.
“You've had a taste of my lips, now it's time to savor my feast," she giggled softly. 
“Ah, yes, garlic soup, roast lamb, garden potatoes, and coconut milk to flush it all down…uh what’s this … burnt carrots?”
“My maid did, she showed the carrots some extra love and gave them a char,” she cackled.
"Charred, ha! I got myself nearly charred today Shija!, a lightning struck so close by” she gasped a bit “and my horse gave me something to remember," he said, touching the wound on his forehead.
“It will heal, if one doesn’t touch them these many often,” as she pulled his hand away and aside, “Where did it happen?”
“On the slopes of Arvata. Followed by a thunder so deafening as well.,” as he put a heavy bite of lamb in his mouth.
"Those slopes are ever thundering. You know, that's why the {Whisperers} does frequent that peak to catch the whispers."
“Ha, you have found yourself just where I wanted “he said, sipping a bit of coconut milk.
“Has my prince blessed with a whisper as well? she got curious, “was it about us?”
“No, I intend to keep our moans out of Gods’ ears {…} yet this whisper seems rather undeniable. Care to offer your thoughts?”
“I thought all whispers are undeniable.”
“The charm of the whispers lies in the choice they present; to follow or to forsake them, is entirely one’s fancy.,” he said with a wry smile.
“I see, if it pleases, what did the whispers speak to you?”, 
“The whispers called me to leave the Lord’s reign and venture beyond the mountains to seek a bond, one not of blood……. I wonder who the whispers concern.” He said with a gleaming smile.
"Could it be him?" she asked, her voice trembling with anticipation.
"Yes," he replied softly.
"Your...?"
"Yes, a friend from my earliest days." Shantanu confirmed.
“His name is on everyone’s lips, from the High Silks to the scrap sellers, my maids too -- they all call him the Athreya.!” 
"That title condemned him to his exile," Shantanu replied, bitterness lacing his words. Athreya—the fated one, the bringer of change. It is a burdened name to bear, and it has cost him dearly,” he sighed.
He continued, "His father was unforgiving; he was just an ordinary young man then, erring and learning, just like every other.”
“What kind of err would get a boy exiled?”
"The kind that makes a father see his own son as a threat," he said quietly. "A mistake that showed too much promise, too much power. And for that, he was cast out."
Shija tilted her head, curiosity gleaming in her eyes. "When did the two of you first become acquainted?"
Shantanu's gaze drifted to the past, a faint smile touching his lips. "He had been exiled twice more before his last banishment. The second time he was sent away, he made his way to Shylva Varta. I encountered him—or rather, he found me—by the river Varaaha. We were but young lads then—he, no more than twelve, and I, just sixteen."
Shija listened intently, her heart aching for the young man she had never met. "What was he like then?"
"Lost," Shantanu said, his voice softening. “Yet, full of hope. He appeared much younger, a mere boy in stature, but had a mind that belied his years. Even in exile, he refused to be broken.”
“Now that he is back after 14 years, {The land of the Mudhaliyars} is in turmoil now. 
"I've heard as much. What mother would usurp the throne from her daughter?"
“The sort that did not bear her. She was born out of wedlock, nevertheless she loved her like one of her own until she was named heir by the Mudhaliyar himself.”
“Varadharaj is many things, but he is not one to covet power. His quest remains unknown, as does where his loyalties lie. Now that the whispers have beckoned me, I must soon understand my position in this unfolding of events. It has been mere days since Varadha set foot in {the Southern Realm}. Surely, he has come back to reclaim his honor.  Such burdens must weigh heavily upon him as well.”

Shija shook her head, her eyes wide with disbelief. “And you think this whisper ties you to him? That you must share his fate?”
“That much is certain, is it not? - a bond not born within.”
“My prince I worry you seem too certain of this whisper. They are to be interpreted with much thought, something the {whisperers} spend their lifetime to do.” 
“Shija, this calling…. never felt clearer…I felt that thunder in my heart...Varadharaj’s return is no mere coincidence.”
"I am no Whisperer, but this much I know: whispers are often the most perilous," Shija cautioned, her voice softening. "It is your duty to discern true destiny from mere desire. I believe you are making too hasty a decision based on a whisper you only heard this midday."
“A prudent suggestion,” Shantanu agreed. “We shall leave at first light.”
Shantanu paced the chamber, his mind racing. “Varadharaj has returned to a land in turmoil. His father slain, his sister's claim to the throne challenged by their own kin. The realm is a cauldron of strife and betrayal. If my presence can aid him, if the whisper has indeed foretold this path, then I must follow it.”
“But at what cost?” Shija implored. “Your kingdom needs you. I need you. This path you are considering could lead to ruin, not just for you, but for all who depend on you.”

My prince Shantanu, I would not want you anywhere but in Shylva, she took his hands from her thighs and kissed it, her eyes sorrow with uncertainty.
