Subject: Request for Leave Due to Grandfather's Passing

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you of some unfortunate news regarding my family. My grandfather passed away recently, and as a result, I will need to take some time off to attend his funeral and be with my family during this difficult time.

I understand the importance of my responsibilities at work, and I assure you that I will do everything I can to ensure that my tasks are covered during my absence. I am willing to delegate my duties and provide any necessary information to ensure a smooth transition in my absence.

I plan to be away from [start date] to [end date]. However, I am flexible and can adjust my leave dates as needed based on any pressing work commitments.

I apologize for any inconvenience my absence may cause, and I appreciate your understanding and support during this challenging time.

Thank you for considering my request. Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are any additional steps I need to take regarding my leave.

Sincerely,
